                <li>volume->Part 1\nOn the darkest night, a star fell down. A village, curious, approached the place, but instead of a star, they found a majestic being. The creature, fatally wounded and bleeding, saw them approach, and begged a single request.\n\\Consume me.//\nThe village, that night, had a great feast.</li>
                <li>volume->Part 2\nOn a night full of stars, a peculiar child was born.\nThe village recognized him as a a gift from the stars.\nAnd so, the first great foxian became their leader and in following years, although young, turned what was a small village in a beautiful kingdom.</li>
                <li>volume->Part 3\nThe king was offered gifts from nearby lands.\nFood, treasures, women.\nWith 1000 wives, he had 10.000 childrens, that scattered across the lands.\nOf those, 7000 were females, and 3000 were males.</li>
                <li>volume->Part 4\nThe day of the birth of the last child, the king heard a voice speak to him.\n\\1000 wives, not one more. 10.000 childrens, not one more.//\nHe thought of this as a divine message, and in the following years he followed the command.\nBut one day he received as a gift the most beautiful woman he had ever laid his eyes upon.\nThe command was broken soon after.</li>
                <li>volume->Part 5\nThe king had married the woman.\nThe woman was now waiting for a child, but being the last in line for the throne wasnt enough.\nShe wanted to be the queen.\nAnd so, like every kingdom has his enemies, she contacted them and plotted against his own husband.\nSoon enough, the enemies had the castle gate opened to them.</li>
                <li>volume->Part 6\nThe king was stabbed in his sleep 23 times.\nHe opened his eyes, seeing his last wife among the assassin.\nRage took over him, and screamed.\n"May your lineage be cursed for the rest of their life and beyond! May they be mistrated, beaten, used as slaves and may they know excruciating pain! May you become immortal, forced to watch in horror at what you caused, never being able to know the freedom of death and may the pain of existence never cease!"\nAnd so, he left the world immediatly after.</li>
                <li>volume->Final Part\nThe queen never took the throne.\nImmediatly after, the murderers betrayed her, turning her into a slave.\nThe kingdom was over.\nBut the queen life wasnt.\nJust like the King said, the time for her stopped, her child forever stuck inside her.\nNo matter what her owners did to her, she would never die.\nAnd so after many centuries of tortures, she was locked in a jail with no windows, and a wall was built blocking her inside.\nAnd so, even now, she still lives, forgotten by everyone."</li>
