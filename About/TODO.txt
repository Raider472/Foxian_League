Basic stuff

IMPORTANT Replace Rand to Verse.Rand
Use of gizmos might make the mod not compatible for multiplayer

maybe option to allow girl only ? + chance for gender on non-foxian
    -Most mods use the PawnGenerator.GeneratePawn method
    -I'm patching the pregnUtility applybirthoutcome to save the mother and make a letter when a foxian is born
Check if genetic purity can be changed/refractor (removing mother field and etc.)

-Important !!!

Dubs Analyzer - Check if each method is implemented without causing lags
-Optimize composed mind gene
-Natural psy sensitive -> ok 0.004 to 0.012 ms
-Check if psychic sensitivty changes if the mod is deactivated or not (around 13-14% usage in stats)
-Change the code for the ticking genes, now it will take 2.5 seconds to update (This improved performaces a little bit)
