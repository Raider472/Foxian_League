Foxian Genes
    V-lustful (high libido and bisexual)
    V-very beautiful (base game)
    V-reduced fertility
    V-only female

    V-Genetic Purity (65% chance of normal foxian, 35% chance of greater foxian then 70% male and 30% female greater foxian + only female)
        -2 behaviours:
            -1 Pawn is Foxian and does the mentioned above
            -2 Pawn is not Foxian
                -baby will receive all active gene of the mother depending if the gene is xeno or endo
        V-Add notification when greater foxian has been borned
        V-Fix Xenotype still displaying normal foxian for greater foxian (Displayed as foxian or hybrid, most likely need to use a transpiler to set the correct xenotype)
            V-Try patching TryGetInheritedXenotype (And maybe is hybrid or something)
            -Should Hybrid be allowed ?
    V-slow aging

    -Weak Stomach -> see after balancing
    V-toxic vulnerability

    V-composed mind
        -NegativeInteractionUtility Harmony Patch
    V-brittle mind
        -Calm (dead calm but less powerful) <- calm dead but mental breakdown lasts much more longer
            -MentalState is when the pawn is during the mental breakdown period -> This is the solution
            -MentalStateHandler.TryStartMentalState is most likely the function that is in need of patching
                -Increase the min and max revovery time by %50 -> No
    V-reserved(higher threshold of mental breakdown +5%, longer removal of bad memories and 0.25 offset)
    V-Loyal Conversdion power + high ideo defense
        - social opinion malus if a colonist is not loyal to the ideo or under a certain threshold
    V-immaculate (clean 0.75%)

    V-Terrible melee
    V-poor mining

    V-heat weakness
    V-Cold resistance

    V-Weak melee damage

    V-Natural psy sensitivity
        -If pawns medidate somewhere else than natural spot, he will recover less psyfocus
        -Pawn_psychicEntropyTracker.GainPsyfocus_NewTemp
        -MeditationUtility.PsyfocusGainPerTick
    V-Psychic manipulation (the more psy sensitivity, the more their social stats increase)
        -Patch social localization
        -Make the skill modifier and psy sensi local to the genedef
        -Two solution for fixing the gene
            -One Check if the gene class is unique or is a copy for each pawn / after testing, the class seems to be unique for each pawn, maybe the genedef is not unique for each pawn ?
            -Second test, check if the stat from the class are unique for each pawn --> RESULT --> the stats are unique for each pawn, so the gene class has multiple instances for each pawn
            SkillRecord GetAptitude
            - Do not use the apptitude in gene def, instead, change the code for apptitude
            -SkillUI -> GetSkillDescription for localization
        -will add small bonus to trade price improvement and negatiation ability
    V-Psychic Taming or Something
        -basic bonuses + less chance for manhunter on failed attempt
        -public static float GetManhunterOnTameFailChance(ThingDef def)
        -Maybe check if it is possible to bug the whole thing by having multiple pawns taming animals ?

    V-reserved
    V-Loyal

    V-great melee
    -great duelist (more dodge, faster melee and strong attack) (Something related with psychic power ?)
    -agile runner (0.10 move speed) (Maybe something related with psychic power ?)
    -Add an ability maybe ?

    V-heat weakness

    V-Natural psy sensitive
    -Fast wound healing but scale with psychic sensitivity
    -superclotting (Maybe include in the above)
    -psy enhancement (the more psychic sensitivy over 100%, the stronger you become. Stats base increase, most likely this would be done with a hediff)
