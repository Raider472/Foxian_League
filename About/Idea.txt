        -Two solution for fixing the gene
            -One Check if the gene class is unique or is a copy for each pawn / after testing, the class seems to be unique for each pawn, maybe the genedef is not unique for each pawn ?
            -Second test, check if the stat from the class are unique for each pawn --> RESULT --> the stats are unique for each pawn, so the gene class has multiple instances for each pawn
